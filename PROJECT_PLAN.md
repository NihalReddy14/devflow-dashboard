# Real-Time Collaboration Project Plan

## Project Decision
Building tools to showcase skills for landing jobs - focusing on real-time collaboration, developer tools, and AI integrations.

## Three Project Options Analyzed

### 1. Live Code Interview Platform
- **What**: Real-time collaborative code editor for technical interviews
- **Features**: Live code editing, syntax highlighting, video/audio chat, cursor tracking, code execution
- **Tech Stack**: WebSockets, WebRTC, Monaco editor, Docker
- **Market**: VERY HIGH competition (CoderPad, HackerRank, CodeSignal)
- **Verdict**: Saturated market

### 2. Team Whiteboard with AI Assistant
- **What**: Collaborative drawing/diagramming with AI suggestions
- **Features**: Real-time drawing, AI diagram suggestions, live cursors, multi-format export
- **Tech Stack**: Canvas API, Socket.io, OpenAI API, Amplify real-time
- **Market**: HIGH competition (Miro, FigJam) but AI integration is NEW opportunity
- **Verdict**: Good opportunity with AI focus

### 3. Developer Workflow Dashboard
- **What**: Real-time dashboard for dev team activity (PRs, builds, deployments)
- **Features**: GitHub integration, AI code review summaries, team activity feed, multi-tool integration
- **Tech Stack**: GitHub API, webhooks, real-time updates, AI integration
- **Market**: MEDIUM competition, mostly enterprise-focused expensive tools
- **Verdict**: BEST OPPORTUNITY - underserved market for small teams/indie devs

## Recommendation
Start with Developer Workflow Dashboard because:
- Less competition for small team segment
- Can start simple with just GitHub integration
- Incremental feature additions possible
- Small teams willing to pay $10-20/month
- Perfectly demonstrates real-time + API + cloud skills

## Current Setup
- Next.js + Amplify Gen 2 app already configured
- Located in: /Users/nihal/Documents/Repos/CHI/Real-Time Collaboration App
- Ready to start building

## Next Steps
When you return, tell me to read PROJECT_PLAN.md and we can:
1. Finalize which project to build
2. Start implementing core features
3. Add real-time functionality with Amplify
4. Integrate AI features
